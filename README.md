# ld64

Apple `ld64` for Debian.  
Also `cctools-strip` because that gets built anyway.

Virtually all of the work here was done by [@tpoechtrager](https://github.com/tpoechtrager), I merely slapped a Makefile in front of everything.

### Binaries

See the [Actions](https://github.com/Siguza/ld64/actions) tab for continuous integration.  
Automatically builds binaries and deb files for Debian/Ubuntu, though artifacts are only kept for 90 days.

Selected builds are uploaded to [Releases](https://github.com/Siguza/ld64/releases), as well as to the [checkra1n APT repo](https://checkra.in/linux).
